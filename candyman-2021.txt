FADE IN:
EXT. CHICAGO AERIAL AT NIGHT
Arteries of traffic bulging along the coast of Lake
Michigan run horizontal across our field of view. We fly
overhead, following the road and just outpacing the cars
below.
The strains of Phillip Glass’ iconic score lend an air of
dread to what is about to unfold. As the music swells...
THE TITLE FLIES IN:
CANDYMAN
EXT. HONEYCOMB
An empty HONEYCOMB fills the screen, honey lugubriously
dripping slowly towards the camera and out of frame. We
hear an all-encompassing whisper, off-screen.
VOICE (V.O.)
Sweets to the sweet.....
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. CHICAGO SKYLINE. DAY
This time we’re looking up at it - the buildings loom
menacingly, choking out the sky. The faintest buzzing
sound swells. Could it be a police scanner? Bees? Both?
DISSOLVE TO:
ANTHONY, a 35-year-old African-American man in closeup.
He’s handsome, but tired.
INT. DIVE BAR. DAY
We stay on Anthony as he listens intently to a story told
by a woman off-screen.
LORRAINE (O.S.)
Everybody around here knows about
Helen.

LORRAINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
It happened a few years back,
before they tore the projects down
and this neighborhood got all
bougie...
CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY, CABRINI GREEN 30 YEARS AGO
This is the worst of government housing. Cinderblocks and
bloodspots. We are at the end of a long hallway, a row
of graffiti-splattered apartments on the left side and
chain-link fences on the right. Slowly, the camera pushes
towards a door at the end of the hallway. Lorraine
continues spinning her tale as we creep towards the door:
LORRAINE (V.O.)
They say she was going around
Cabrini green cuttin’ the heads
off dogs ‘till they brought her
into the mental institution.
That’s when she killed her
Psychiatrist and escaped. Crazy
white bitch didn’t go on the run
either. Nah, she came right here
to the neighborhood. She wanted to
terrorize us.
We hear the sounds of a RAUCOUS CROWD in the background
and the unmistakable SCREAMS OF A TERRIFIED BABY.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
She kidnapped a baby.
The door at the end of the hall flies open, to reveal
HELEN, a fantasy version, lissome and hunched over. Her
dirty long hair mingles with the shadows, obscuring her
features. She’s holding the CRYING BABY.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
That little boy had been missing
for weeks. Lord knows what she
was doing to it during that time.
But the neighborhood all came
together to look for it. Although
at that point, I’m not gonna lie -most of us had given up hope.
Close up on the baby, we see its cherubic cheeks,
streaked with tears.

LORRAINE (V.O.)
But his mama ain’t give up. No
funeral, nothing. Even though it
was weeks, she wasn’t finna
grieve.
EXT. CABRINI GREEN COURTYARD. NIGHT
More dirt than grass, the courtyard is littered with
broken bottles and wayward plastic bags. Something is
happening here. A security door slams open, and Helen
approaches the camera with the vacant determination of a
ghost. Her face, and the face of the infant in her arm
are lit up by flickering of a MASSIVE BONFIRE.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
She walked that little boy down to
the bonfire as casual as a walk in
the park. She was going to roast
that baby like a turkey.
As the fire rages, Helen’s silhouette cuts through the
flames. We see a close up on the baby, flames dancing
across his wet eyes. Slowly, the crowd gathers in the
courtyard, gradually becoming aware of what’s about to
happen.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
People ain’t fuck around in those
days.
The crowd rushes Helen, who with a small controlled
movement of her left arm, slaps three grown men across
the courtyard. But the residents of Cabrini Green over
whelm her, burying her in a dog-pile.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
They say it took ten dudes to get
that baby free, and not a second
too soon.
The baby is back in the arms of safety, still crying.
Several men have Helen pinned down, but her eyes are cold
and emotionless. She does not struggle. At the last
instant, she stands up, tossing a few men aside quite
easily. She turns towards the fire, and WALKS RIGHT IN.
LORRAINE (V.O.)
She burnt herself to death. Just
walked right in and went up like
match stick.

INT. DIVE BAR
Anthony in close-up, hanging on her words and recording
video with his phone. He’s sucking blithely on a piece
of hard candy.
ANTHONY
Why would anybody do that?
We see LORRAINE, 20 now for the first time. She’s
dressed in a hoodie, blithely contemplating some cheese
fries and gravy.
LORRAINE
Shit I don’t know. Bitch crazy.
They say she was on some Candyman
shit.
ANTHONY
“Candyman.” Come on.
The camera goes from a close to medium shot revealing
that BRIANNA, 33, Anthony’s girlfriend, has been seated
next to him the whole time. She clearly doesn’t have
time for any of this shit
What’s that?

BRIANNA
Some kind of drug?

LORRAINE
Damn Brianna. You sure you’re from
Chicago? It was a Cabrini thing;
Legend went that if you say
“Candyman” in a mirror five times,
this giant nigga with a hook hand
comes and kills you. It doesn’t
work. I used to try it with my
friends on Halloween, but Helen
took that shit seriously. She was
obsessed. That’s why she took that
baby. She was trying to sacrifice
it for him.
She eats a fry. Anthony ponders the grim tale.

BRIANNA
Ok, well thanks for your time,
Lorrie.
LORRAINE
I mean, there’s more to the story.
BRIANNA
I’m sure there is, girl, but we
gotta go.
Anthony doesn’t budge. Instead, he reaches into his
inside pocket and produces A PHOTOGRAPH.
ANTHONY
Have you ever seen a painting like
this?
The photograph is of a mural, painted in a traditional
classical style, in which a depiction of Helen stands
saintly in the center, hands in the air, eyes towards
heaven.
Lorraine shakes her head no.
LORRAINE
Who made that?
ANTHONY
I don’t know but I think it’s her.
LORRAINE
Her who? Helen? Nah. That looks
way too nice to be her.
Anthony smiles undeterred.
LORRAINE
Why do you care so much about all
this?
ANTHONY
I’m an artist. My work deals with
the influence of classical
modernism on urban street art.
Found this photo at the library.
Thought it had to be old at first.
They don’t make ‘em like that
anymore, for real. But look...
Anthony turns the picture over revealing a scribbled
date.

Lorraine reads along with him.
LORRAINE
“...Cabrini Green.”
ANTHONY
That was the day after Helen
Lyle’s death.
LORRAINE
Oh snap. For real?
ANTHONY
I think it was painted on one of
the walls there.
LORRAINE
I never saw that, but I was s a
till a kid when it got torn down,
so...
ANTHONY
You got any other friends from the
Cabrini days who you think would
talk to me?
Brianna gets up - she’s had enough.

Snarky:

BRIANNA
Maybe we can get a mirror and ask
Mr. Candyman where this painting
was. Again, great to meet you,
Lorraine.
EXT. DIVE BAR. DAY
Brianna’s car sits at the curb. Around them is a
neighborhood in transition. Upscale chain stores and
upper middle class people with smart phones talking about
parties and galleries are intermingled with cigarette
stores. The dingy bar must have been the last one of its
kind on the block.
INT. BRIANNA’S CAR. DAY
She’s at the wheel. Both Anthony and Brianna sit
silently with the engine off. His eyes drift towards the
rear view mirror.

He’s tempted to say “Candyman” but Brianna looks at him.
The two of them burst out laughing at Anthony’s
embarrassment of getting caught considering trying to
summon a demon.
ANTHONY
I thought you didn’t believe in
shit like this?
BRIANNA
(being funny)
Let me tell you something. If you
ever try to summon a ghost, demon
alien, whatever in my presence, I
will dump your ass so hard.
Anthony laughs.
ANTHONY
Alright, alright. Let’s go.
As Brianna starts the engine, Anthony unwraps and pops a
piece of hard candy into his mouth.
INT. BRIANNA’S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT
It’s a nice place, not lavish by any means, but it’s
clear that Brianna has some resources.
She lays in bed in his shirt from earlier scrolling
through Instagram and calls out to the bathroom.
BRIANNA
I have a meeting tomorrow at 8:00
at the gallery, so I should get up

You need to get painting again,
Anthony. When you gonna write

Anthony goes back to looking in the bathroom mirror.
ANTHONY

Yeah.

BRIANNA

ANTHONY
It’s not written. They want video
proposals.
BRIANNA
That’s good. Maybe you’ll actually
get around to it.
ANTHONY
You’re hilarious. Yeah, I’m gonna
do it soon. I may head back to the
north side tomorrow and ask around
about Candyman though.

Procrastinate? You don’t think
this is fascinating? Nobody was
making art like that in Chicago in
the nineties. Crazy that it even
existed. And that story...
BRIANNA
(skeptical)
Mmmm hmmm... That girl was high as
shit.
Anthony steps out of the bathroom again.
ANTHONY
So what? Does that make her
unreliable?
Brianna shrugs.
ANTHONY
See, you’re like a cop. Makin’
judgments on people, ‘n shit...
She looks at him.
ANTHONY
Fine. I’ll shoot the video
tomorrow.
He goes back to the bathroom. She picks up the picture of
“Helen” on his end table and looks at it.
INT. BRIANNA’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM. NIGHT
Brianna is speaking loudly from the other room.

We follow Anthony’s hands as they caress the contours of
Brianna’s body.

Anthony wakes up. Brianna’s side of the bed is disrupted.
She’s gone. He gets up.
CUT TO:
INT. BRIANNA’S APARTMENT, HALLWAY. DAY
Anthony roots around in the closet. He finds his old
cans of spray paint, bringing him back to a time when he
used to tag the Southside. He sees photographs of
himself as a child, clinging to the pant leg of his
mother outside a bodega. He sees photographs of his
early, groundbreaking street art: Grim, minimalist nooses
spray-painted on walls in different locations throughout
Chicago. The nooses look like they are hanging from
shadows cast by trees, but the pictures must’ve been
taken at the perfect time of for the shadows to align.

A small extra bedroom, crammed with art supplies, an
overstuffed desk with a small mirror and a small blank
canvas.
Through the window the black membrane of the
Chicago night strains to hold the morning sky from
punching through. A small camcorder is set on a tripod.
Anthony checks his hair and teeth in the mirror and
presses record.
ANTHONY
Hello, my name is Anthony McCoy,
and please accept this grant
proposal as a bid for ...ya money

He amuses himself somewhat.

Back to seriousness...

ANTHONY (CONT’D)
Hello, I’m Anthony McCoy and my
work is concerned with outlier
artworks created in low-income
Chicago neighborhoods in the
1990’s. While I realize that up
to now my previous paintings have
dealt more directly with the
problematics of systemic racism,
I’m changing it up a bit. I...
Anthony slumps back in his chair. Unable to feign

EXT. MARGARET HIE DING LIN PARK, BASKETBALL COURT. DAY
This place is a mecca for street basketball pick-up
games. Underneath the L, the courts are caged-off and
packed with folks rocking number twenty-three and the
occasional 45 on their jerseys. Crowds swell around the
sidelines, hoping for a peek at the next Derrick Rose.
Anthony, deep into a five-on-five, pulls down a
contentious rebound, passes and makes his way crosscourt.
He sets a pick, gets jostled hard, but stands his ground.
Rolling off, he cuts to the basket and calls for the
ball.

He catches the pass, turns, shoots and get REJECTED to

JIM TRASK
Foul! That’s a foul! Damn!.
Anthony’s friend JIM TRASK (33) helps him up as the other
team quickly and dominantly wins the game. Jim continues
to appeal to the players. It wasn’t a foul
JIM
How is that not a foul?! How is
that not a foul?!
MOMENTS LATER...
Anthony and Jim walk lean against the chain link fence as
the next game is played.
JIM
People cheating out here, man.
Niggas out here committing capital
murder ‘n shit, and no one’s
calling shit? Meanwhile this Clyde
Drexler looking motherfucker
exclusively throwing hooks!
Jim, trying hard to be heard heckling from the sidelines,
lights a cigarette. The flame jets out high which makes
Anthony weirdly jump.
JIM (CONT’D)
Whoa, you good?
ANTHONY
Yeah, I’m good.

JIM
Why? I mean sure, but this area
still isn’t really fully appealing
to the affluent yet. Shit don’t

too.
ANTHONY
Really? Feels like there are so
many police these days, though.
JIM
They’re part of the problem.
Police brutality doesn’t help

more crime. It’s a damn cycle.
ANTHONY
Yeah, that’s the oldest story in
America.
JIM
Deadass. How about you? How’s
Brianna? You gonna put a ring on
it? Because you are not going to

You know why? You take part in a
boring, sad-as-hell art form. Know
what you should do? One of those
‘dogs playing poker’ joints.
ANTHONY
You want me to put that on an
airbrushed R.I.P. Biggie bomber

JIM
Yeah, I’m basic. I probably would
like that. So what?
I gotta go.

ANTHONY

He starts walking away.
JIM
Where you goin’? Aiight. End the
conversation on a cryptic note
then.
INT. BRIANNA’S ART GALLERY, EVENING.
It’s a small group art show where various paintings from
different artists line the walls. Three photos of
Anthony’s Nooses Series hang in a row on the wall. Some
nooses appear to hang shadows cast by statues.
- Cows in the Cow Parade
- The Miro outside the Chicago Temple Building
- The Godness of Industry outside the trade building
The event itself is sparsely attended, but Brianna and
Anthony are dressed for success. She circulates with a
drink in one hand and a brochure in another. WILCOTT

what’s what with urban art approaches Anthony.

ROSE ESTATES, DAY

Anthony, hungover from a lack of sleep, slouches into The
Rose Estates, a few small poorly-maintained buildings
clustered together at the end of a lonely, in-transition
block. Once low-income housing, they’ve been converted
to a home for senior citizens.
INT. ROSE ESTATES, LOBBY. DAY
It’s a modest alcove with an unmanned makeshift security
desk. The walls decorated with cheery inspirational
posters and empty vases. Anthony walks through to the
elevator.
INT. ROSE ESTATES, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. DAY
The elevator creaks open, and Anthony makes his way down
the hall. Every room in the hallway is adorned with a
small white board. On each one, the name of the occupant
is cheerily printed in temporary, washable magic marker.
Anthony stops at the one marked “Anne” and takes a deep
breath.
INT. ROSE ESTATES, ANNE MCCOY’S ROOM. DAY
Not great in here either, folks. The room is neat, but
sparsely decorated with a combination of framed
photographs and little stuffed animals - mostly dogs.
ANNE McCOY, 65, is perched precariously on a creaky
cafeteria chair holding a broom, poking at a small air
vent when the door clicks open.

Nobody would even know.

died..? Candyman did it. That’s
how the community would neglect
taking responsibility.
ANTHONY
Okay, so what was his deal?
ANNE
Why are we talking about such
unpleasant things. I thought you
were stopping by to bring me some
shit.
Come on, mom.

ANTHONY

ANNE
Supposedly, he was an artist back
in the olden days, just like you.
His name was Daniel... Daniel
Robitille. His daddy was a slave,
but he was a free man. He was
hired to paint a portrait of a
rich white man’s daughter, but he
fell for her; knocked her up. Him
being a free man didn’t mean much
in those days, and when the girl’s
father heard what he had done he
hired some men.
Uh oh.

ANTHONY

ANNE
Yes, uh oh. They cut off his hand,
stripped him naked, poured honey
on him and let bees sting him half
to death. Then they lit him up,
burnt him ...the fire took care of
the other half.

this?
Anthony shows her the picture of “Helen”. Anne’s face
goes dark.
ANNE
I haven’t been back to Cabrini for
a long-ass time. It’s a bad place.
A murder a day when we lived
there.
ANTHONY
It’s barely the same neighborhood.
Unrecognizable. Gentrified now.
ANNE
That’s not how ‘bad places’ work.
You can put a mask on a monster,
that doesn’t make it stop being a
monster. It’s all the same
underneath.
Underneath...

ANTHONY

Anthony ponders this and looks out the window.
EXT. CHICAGO’S NEAR NORTH SIDE, DUSK
The Old Town chic had crept considerably northwards since
Anne’s day. The coffee shops and retail stores make it
clear that gentrification hasn’t quite overwhelmed the
area that once housed the towers of Cabrini, but the
outcome is inevitable. ANTHONY walks purposefully down
the street, arriving at a small antique store.

in, but you know how it goes.
The Gold Coast Code switch goes into effect.
LEONARD
I’m sorry, young blood. Jake
passed in November. Good brother
though.
Damn.

ANTHONY
He got killed?

Leonard nods. Doesn’t want to talk about it, and frankly,
neither does Anthony. He knows how that story goes.
ANTHONY
The stuff you have here, where’s
it from?

LEONARD
From all over, man. I’ve got fur
coats from Paris, although fur
doesn’t move the way it used to.
I got video games from Japan that
you can’t get here in the states.
A little bit of everything.
A Chicago Bears pennant is pinned above the doorway.
ANTHONY
But some of this is from the hood
too, no? Consignments or
whatever.
LEONARD
Yeah man, of course. Most of it,
matter of fact. Estate sales, you
know.
ANTHONY
You got a downstairs?
Yeah why?

LEONARD

ANTHONY
I’m doing a project about Cabrini
Green.
Oh.

LEONARD

ANTHONY
See I think the basement level of
Cabrini would’ve extended been
right up to the wall of your
basement. I was wondering if I
could check it out down there; see
if there’s any way to... I don’t
know. Maybe I’m just being stupid.
LEONARD
You can go down there and take a
look if you want. Long as you buy
some shit.
Anthony pops a candy into his mouth.

INT. PURCELL’S, BACK OF STORE
Leonard walks Anthony to a small padlocked door next to
an out-of-order water fountain. He patiently picks
through an incredulously massive key ring.
LEONARD
Tell you the truth, Jake was a
junk man’s junk man. Sentimental
as hell though. I guess that’s
why he got into this business.
Shit probably me too.
ANTHONY
Not much to be sentimental about
anymore.
LEONARD
I suspect that’s why business
stays good for me though. Butcher
just sells meat, and you can get
that at Whole Foods. Hardware
store sells hammers, and you can
get better ones at Home Depot.
But all this shit? These are
stories. Without stories, what
was never was, we all pretty much
lost. Can’t sell that at Whole
Foods.
ANTHONY
You drunk, man?
Hell yeah.

LEONARD
Here it is.

The lock clicks open, and Leonard opens the door
revealing a narrow staircase into the dark basement
below.
INT. PURCELL’S BASEMENT
The view from the bottom of the stairs. Anthony and
Leonard look down into the darkness. We hear Anthony
crunch his candy.
LEONARD
Go ahead, man.
He flips on the light and a few feeble uncovered
lightbulbs pop on.

(CONTINUED)

7/7/18

CONTINUED:
LEONARD
Take your time, I’m at my desk.
Don’t break yo ass.
Anthony makes his way down the stairs alone. Despite its
low ceiling, the basement itself is seemingly larger than
the cramped quarters above. The contents of the makeshift
shelves are not afforded the same dignity of presentation
as their upstairs neighbors. The bulk of the items, a
random assortment of bureaus, breakfronts, armoires and
coffee tables are rested at odd angles. Dropcloths are
deployed with no clear logic. It’s a labyrinth designed
for convenience of access, not curb appeal. At the center
of the room are FOUR FULL-LENGTH MIRRORS, each set into
wooden frames boasting styles from classical to
contemporary. Against the walls, canvases lean into one
another in uneven stacks. Anthony peruses the largest
among them:
- A badly water-stained, framed poster of Sam Cooke
- A framed, hand-painted map of the Celtic Brittany
region
- A photograph of a pale woman looking at herself in a
mirror
- A painting of a fisherman on a riverbank, the hook at
the end of his line without a fish.
While Anthony takes a moment to absorb this last one, he
hears something. The buzzing. He turns his attention to
the back of the room, where the bulbs have all gone out.
He makes his may through the stacks, and notices
something beneath his feet. He bends down to pick it up.
It’s a scrap of canvas torn from a painting. The hues
are red and gold. He picks it up and ventures deeper into
the darkness. He finds another. And another. The
buzzing intensifies. He follows the sound to the edge of
the room, and a doorless doorway revealing a utility
closet.
INT. PURCELL’S BASEMENT, UTILITY CLOSET
In here, the poured concrete floors have given way to
filthy, water-logged tile. The only notable features of
the cramped room are a giant workman’s sink and a dingy
metallic silver trap door on the floor. He looks at it
and sees a corrupted hazy reflection.

He searches for a handle and finds one, where there was
once a padlock. He opens the door...
CUT TO:
INT. A DARK TUNNEL. NIGHT
Anthony pops his head in upside-down. It takes a second
for his inverted vision to adjust to the dark. Below him
is a large dank corridor.
Holy Hell.

ANTHONY

Anthony takes out his phone and turns on the flashlight
and explores, the long-abandoned space with it. Laundry
machines line one room, and the walls are covered with
art. Not standard graffiti either. Curious, Anthony leans
in to get a better angle, when a large cockroach scurries
around his hand.
Oh shit!

ANTHONY

Anthony slips and falls. He lands on his back. He gets
up.
ANTHONY
Fuck! Hey! Yo!
Anthony looks though the portal above. Nothing. He picks
up his phone, the light illuminates the walls.
They look like they were painted by a master of classical
oil painting, depicting an angry mob of white men in 19th
century garb running down its length with torches.
Yo.

ANTHONY

He takes video as he goes.
ANTHONY
I’m in what I believe to be the
laundry level floor of the Cabrini
Green projects. Don’t let anyone
tell you graffiti ain’t art.
He’s pulled down the hallway by his own fascination.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
You can tear down the walls, but
as long as something survives, so
will the story. It’s... it’s
beautiful.

Before he knows it he’s a ways down the dark hall. All of
a sudden, his phone BUZZES loud. He drops it sending him
once again into the black.
Shit.

ANTHONY

He picks it up in time to see it’s Brianna who’s calling,
but the phone stops ringing.
He shines the light in front of him and realizes he’s at
the end of the tunnel before him on the wall is the
painting he’s been looking for. It’s Helen in all her
glory, looking beautiful and pure of intention. It’s now
clear the portrait is of Helen engulfed in flames.
Anthony documents every corner of the wall before turning
around. At the other end of the hallway a figure stands.
Anthony’s breath quickens.
Hello?

ANTHONY

The figure is still. Anthony slowly makes his way towards
the trap door on the ceiling in the middle of the
hallway, keeping an eye on the figure the whole time. As
he gets there he squints and leans in to see the figure
appears to be a painted silhouette of a man with a hook
for a hand. The words “Sweets to the Sweet” are scrawled
above in more chaotic lettering than is anywhere else in
the hallway. Anthony, petrified looks up again.
Hey--

ANTHONY

Leonard pops out!
LEONARD
Look, what you went and did. Hold
tight. I got a ladder somewhere.
Anthony doesn’t realize it, but he’s dropped his wallet
in the initial fall.

INT. PURCELL’S, NIGHT
LEONARD
Now, you ain’t gonna sue, right?
That was your idea; I didn’t want
you to go down there.
ANTHONY
Nah. I’m good.
Anthony and Leonard walk from the back of the store when
A LOUD CRASH from the front jolts them..
Leonard into a run towards the front window, now smashed
away.
Fuck you!

LEONARD
Come back you cowards!

ANTHONY
What happened?
LEONARD
Goddamned Hitler youth shitbags
threw a car battery through my
window. Motherfuckers.
EXT. PURCELL’S. NIGHT
Anthony opens the door cautiously and looks out into the
night. Feigning a modicum of courage, he steps out into
the street and addresses Leonard through the now nonexistent front-store window.
ANTHONY
Call the police!
LEONARD
The police? You trying to die
tonight?
ANTHONY
I bet they headed over to
Division.
LEONARD
Respect to you for that, but chill
out. You go after them, then what?
Huh? What are you gonna do?
Go

Anthony starts to walk away. He’s still worked up.
LEONARD
You’re not calling an Uber?
ANTHONY
Nah, it’s only a few blocks to the
L.
Leonard is still behind the desk, but we see him from a
new angle. This reveals a shelf with weapons.
LEONARD
Here, take this. Just in case.
It’s a meat cleaver.
I’m good.

Anthony waves it off.
ANTHONY

EXT. CHICAGO’S NEAR NORTH SIDE, NIGHT
Anthony walks away the store. The streets are mostly
silent, interrupted only by the scattered punctuations of
a drunken yell and barking dog. For a place that’s
supposed to be gentrified, the old neighborhood looks
pretty fucking rough at night. Anthony finds himself
conscious of his clothes, his haircut. He never felt
softer in his life.
The bright lights of a STARBUCKS cut through the windows
forming geometric squares on the sidewalk. Like a moth to
flame...
INT. STARBUCKS, NIGHT
Green and white. Fluorescent and smooth. Exposed
bourgeoisie brick. There are only a handful of customers
gathered, but business is brisk here compared to
Purcell’s. Anthony approaches the counter. He’s dirty

plucky.

more rowdy than the atmosphere calls for. They distract
and unsettle Anthony for a second. One of them is holding

A THIRD DUDE walks out of the bathroom. Anthony jumps out
of line and catches it before the door swings shut.
INT. STARBUCKS, BATHROOM. NIGHT
Anthony goes to the urinal. There’s an arrow drawn on the
wall pointing down to it. Anthony looks. On the spot in
the urinal where the little fly decal is usually placed
is a living bee.
ANTHONY
What the fuck?
INT. STARBUCKS, NIGHT
Anthony exits and the situation has blossomed into a fullblown scene with every eye in the place on Anthony. The
other Dudes walk over, ready to throw down.
DUDE ONE

Anthony turns towards the Barista who is on the phone
trying to make it look like he’s not calling the cops on

Yeah!

DUDE THREE

Anthony is reeling from the punch while a sound from his
pocket cuts through the night: BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ. Brianna
is trying to Facetime.
Anthony immediately takes it.
ANTHONY
What’s up babe?
He’s fully surrounded by bloodthirsty dudes.
BRIANNA (ON FACETIME)
Hey baby-- whoa. Are you bleeding?
What the fuck?
The three fuck-head dudes are momentarily astounded at
the audacity of taking a facetime call while they’re
trying to kick your ass.
ANTHONY
Hang on one sec.
Anthony takes off in a full sprint in the opposite
direction. The dudes give chase. Anthony ducks around a
corner, and then another one. He slips behind a dumpster
and the pursuers fly by. Anthony catches his breath in
the parking lot of a closed chain restaurant. Brianna
still on Facetime.

He’s breathing heavy, but trying to play it cool, we see
her face, over his shoulder, in the smartphone screen:
ANTHONY
That was crazy. That was-CRACK!
A HAMMER smashes Anthony’s hand, knocking the phone out
of the frame. But the frame does not change. Another
more violent blow descends upon Anthony’s arm, and a bone
in his right arm becomes clearly dislodged. Anthony
screams.
DUDE ONE

Dude Three cackles.

More heavy blows come down on him.

A shadowy hook-wielding figure stands in the reflection
of a restaurant window across the street from the parking

Brianna squints on the screen - she glimpses the figure

Fade up under the fluorescents. The buzzing gives way to

down the hallway. We pan over from the Helen photo,
which is suddenly flipped face down by a hand with a
banging manicure. Brianna hates that photo. She is
sitting at the side of Anthony’s bed. He’s cleaned up,

Anthony and Brianna are seated across from HOSPITAL
ADMINISTRATOR COLLINS (45) and DETECTIVE LIPEZ (35.)
Collins is a worried-looking woman who has seen some shit
in her day. Lipez, pounding an iced-coffee, is probably
too handsome for his own good.
COLLINS
When we brought you in, you were
unconscious. You had sustained a
concussion and multiple fractures
on the back of your head and
spine. While not superficial, we
don’t expect any lasting side
effects once they heal. But most
critically, your right arm and

He’s in his studio, deep in concentration, painting
furiously on a small canvas with his casted hand and
sucking on a candy. Chance the Rapper’s BLESSINGS is

Anthony’s expression turns to fear. Suddenly face

responders working on a motionless woman. It’s Anne.
She’s so badly stung that her entire body is swollen
nearly beyond recognition. The EMTs tense up defensively

At approximately 2:45 AM, somebody
forced open the front door to the
retirement community knows as the
Rose Estates. The perpetrator
then appears to have punctured the
on-duty guard, a Mister Bernard

large sharp object. That’s the

TURNER, is leaning against the corner behind him.
Anthony sits across from Lipez, handcuffed to the chair.
His look is enigmatic - almost defiant.

He stopped at apartment 407.
He waits for a reaction.

Doesn’t get one.

LIPEZ (CONT’D)
That’s your mother’s apartment,
Anthony. The assailant
...SOMEHOW... had access to the
key for that apartment. Only
three of those keys as far as I
can tell. One was on the keychain
of a man who was just murdered,
another was inside the apartment.
We’ll get back to that third key.
The perpetrator then entered the
apartment while Anne Marie McCoy
slept. She’s a deep-sleeper too,
huh, Anthony? And with the amount
of pills she had at her bedside.

we’ve matched the same weapon to
three other murders at which Mr.

BROKEN MIRRORS, and it bends around corners and into the
distance, somehow bouncing sunlight around from a spot of
daylight far out of sight. The furnishings in this area
are few. A table and chairs pilfered from the streets.
Some rugs cover the floor, overlapping at odd angles.
Anthony sits unconscious in a PLASTIC-COVERED LOVESEAT,
across from him Helen sits smoking a cigarette in a
DETACHED BATHTUB.
She wears a roughly torn piece of canvas with a face
painted on it. The same face from the painting, now
crudely-fashioned into a mask. The canvas “mask” is tied
to her head with a bright red ribbon. Her hair has been
burnt away and her head is covered in scars. This is

legends. The stories that made us
who we were. The stories that
don’t get told anymore.

Motherfuckers...
LEONARD
Killed by the police right outside
this store. He was a little lit
up no doubt. Mouthed off,
harmless shit. Can’t do that
anymore for damn sure. Was
reaching for ID, and cops took his
wallet for a nine. Six shots,
bled out on the pavement.
That’s sad.

I hope you find him.
EXT. PURCELL'S. NIGHT
Brianna walks out and takes out her phone. She calls Jim.
Hello...

JIM (O.S.)

BRIANNA
Hey. I just tried Purcell’s. The
place is weird, but I think..
A hand with chloroform comes around from Brianna’s back
and held to her face. She struggles and screams but fall
asleep in a man’s arms.
JIM (O.S.)
Brianna...? Brianna...!!
CUT TO:
INT. ACCESS TUNNEL SYSTEM. NIGHT
Brianna lies motionless on the ground. After a beat, she
catches her breath and rolls over onto her back. Leonard
is down there with her. There are now shards of mirror
hanging everywhere from strings at different heights.
Leonard holds the kitchen knife and threatens her to move
forward.
LEONARD
I hear you lookin’ for Candyman,
bitch.
BRIANNA
What the fuck did you do?
LEONARD
I can’t tell you how many times I
tried to summon him, but he never
came. They built little memorials
for him... shrines I guess, hidden
all around the neighborhood, just
like this. I made this one for
her. See, it’s like a dance.

backs Brianna into the fetid bathroom.

He slowly

LEONARD
Still don’t believe? The history
is real, my sister.
Fuck you.

BRIANNA

She turns and kicks Leonard in the crotch. HE WAILS
buying her a moment to break from his grasp. She runs
through THE HANGING TRAIL OF BROKEN MIRRORS at all
heights which stretch in both directions.
Leonard YELPS a taunting YELP as he follows her.
Brianna examines her surroundings trying to gauge which
way is out. She makes her way down the corridor, but the
shattered mirrors hanging from the ceiling increase in
density, cutting her and slowing her down significantly.
She winces. As the sounds of Leonard moving through the
mirrors behind her TINKLES closer she changes plan. She
moves up against a wall. She tries to silence her quick
breath as the TINKLE of Leonard pushes near. But instead
of going past, he stops. He can’t see her through them,
but somehow he knows she’s near. He speaks into the
space.
LEONARD
See, Candyman kept this community
together. When he was out there,
you’d hold your man tighter. You’d
go to bed earlier. When the city
forgets us, it’s Candyman that
reminds us that we were human. But
in order for that to happen,
innocent blood must be spilled in
his name.
Brianna thinks hard as he gets closer she looks down and
sees an old rusty bike wheel laying against the wall. She
quickly grabs it an just as Leonard approaches she rolls
it back down the hallway TINKLING GLASS as it goes.
Leonard takes the bait.

Left without viable options, Brianna sets off, deeper
into the tunnel, delicately navigating the inverted
forest of sharp edges. Despite her best efforts the cuts
still come. And worse, it seems like the density of
broken mirrors is increasing in this direction as well.
All of a sudden she’s face to face with...
ANTHONY (O.C.)

Brianna.
AAAGGHHH!!!!

BRIANNA

Dressed in a long, thick coat, Anthony is standing right
in front her, smiling warmly. Brianna breaks down.
ANTHONY
Damn baby chill.
Anthony!

BRIANNA
Where have you been?

ANTHONY
Taking some time, I guess; to get
my head together.
Brianna breaks down.
BRIANNA
That man. He attacked me.
What man?

ANTHONY

Leonard is gone.
BRIANNA
That man from the damn shop.
Parnell... Parvell... Par...
Mr. Purcell?

ANTHONY

BRIANNA
Yes, that mutherfucker! He

I don’t know.

BRIANNA

Puzzled...
ANTHONY
That’s okay...
With that, he turns around and walks through the forest
of glass shards. It tinkles as he passes through it like
a giant, pleasant, wind chime.
BRIANNA
Anthony! Nope. Nope. You gonna
have to come over here and part
these damn shards of glass. I’m
serious. I’m cut the fuck up, and
I’m not playin’. Let’s go.
Anthony continues. Brianna pulls her hoodie tight over
her head for extra protection, and moves a little bit
faster. The broken shards catch and rend the fabric with
ease. Through the light, Brianna catches only glimpses of
a long dark coat refracted across the pieces of a
thousand mirrors. The aggregation of tiny lacerations
begins to take its toll.
BRIANNA
This mutherfucker got me walking
through shards of glass.
She suddenly emerges into a larger space. Behind her,
the dense thicket of sharp edges looms ominously. What’s
ahead of her shakes her to her core. The wall ahead is a
huge mural Of Candyman and HELEN in a fiery embrace.
Anthony stands before it, in glorious reverence. He
raises his arm brandishing THE BLOODY HOOK, now crudely
attached to the stump where his hand once was. Briana
breaks down.
ANTHONY
Come, Brianna.
BRIANNA
What did you do to yourself?
ANTHONY
It was time for a better
paintbrush.
Anthony is truly gone.

BRIANNA
Anthony - This is fucked up.
ANTHONY
I found it. I found my
inspiration. Can you see my work?
Anthony caresses the hanging glass moving towards her.
She grabs a shard of glass off a string and brandishes
it.
BRIANNA
How do I get out of here..?!!
How...? Tell me!!!
Up.

ANTHONY

Suddenly, a knife stabs Brianna’s back she screams in
pain and doubles over on the floor. Leonard stands behind
her. Anthony looks over to him enraged.
ANTHONY (CONT’D)
What did you do?
LEONARD
Helping you, Candyman. Innocent
blood must be spilled. We need
you.
ANTHONY
I’m not Candyman.
Hook raised, Anthony strides purposefully and
threateningly towards Leonard. Leonard drops the knife
and kneels.
LEONARD
Yes. Do it. Take me. That’s how
the legend lives on. You know it
as well as I do.
Helen is standing in front of the wall behind Anthony.
HELEN
To be whispered about at street
corners; to live in other people’s
dreams....
Anthony’s face is welling with the tears and rage of a
man who has already left something behind.

HELEN (CONT’D)
It is a blessed condition.
In one fell swoop, Anthony swings upwards, gravely
impaling Leonard between the legs. He grunts with effort
as he roughly drags the hook upwards through Leonard’s
torso. The blood spills across the floor of nooses. Candy
torn from some inner pockets of leonard’s suit tumble
across the wet ground.
Close up on Anthony, as he contemplates his new
appendage, the freshly-bloody hook. He stands stunned,
seemingly lost in grief and disorientation for a long
beat. When we cut back wide, the nooses are gone, but
the two bodies flanking him remain. He turns towards
Brianna and kneels down in front of her weeping.
ANTHONY
I’m confused. I don’t know what’s
going on. I’m so sorry about all
of this. Helen, where are you?
Help me.
He gets up and approaches the wall painting searching for
Helen. Brianna seizes the moment, picks up the knife from
the floor and levels it at Anthony. Calmly:
BRIANNA
Stay away from me.
Something moves behind the painting.
Anthony, mutilated and disoriented, bloody and broken,
looks decrepit in his oversized fur coat.
ANTHONY
She saved me, Bri.
BRIANNA
Who? Who saved you? Do you look
fucking saved, nigga?
The shadow of Helen emerges in the distance, next to her
portrait.
Brianna runs back towards the exit.
ANTHONY
Wait, Brianna!

Anthony makes the tough decision. He leaves Helen and
runs after Brianna.

Brianna crawls up the ladder and into the back of the

doorway.
LIPEZ
What’s this? What are we doing?
EMT #1
Taking her to the hospital.
Why?

EMT #1
Why? She’s been shot. Stabbed to I

Where’s your boyfriend...? Huh...?
Where’d he go?
Brianna just looks out the window. Jim continues to try
to reason with the cops outside the car.
LIPEZ
Right to remain silent huh? Suit
yourself, but know this. Your
boyfriend is a murderer.
Brianna watches as Jim gets taken down. Three police men
start kicking his ass.
LIPEZ
We’re gonna find him with or
without you, but if you help us,
we’ll take it easy on you. If not,
you’re going down for a long long
time. So please, I’ll ask you one
more time. Where the fuck is your
boyfriend?
We broke up.

BRIANNA

Lipez laughs long and hard.
LIPEZ
Ah, alright. Let me tell you a
story. Once there was a couple of
thugs. They were an item too. Like
a couple of black Bonnie and Clyde
wannabees you know? He’d hold em
down, she slashed. Anyway, they
went on a murder spree. Killed
three guys on the street, killed a
guy that worked at the home his
mother lived in, killed his
mother, and even the poor attorney
that tried to defend him. The best
part is the end. You wanna hear
the end of the story? Huh?
Brianna grits her teeth. Jim outside the car is beat up
and bloody. He rises long enough to look through the
window at Brianna before the cops take him back down and
continue the relentless beating. Tears of anger stream
down Brianna’s face.

Mr. Lipez?
What?

LIPEZ

BRIANNA
Can I see myself?
LIPEZ
What? You look like shit.
BRIANNA
I’d like to see.
Lipez is confused, but realizing whatever mental break
he’s witnessing is pathetic. He loves it. He turns the
rear view mirror so she’s looking at herself.
There...

Brianna stare turns dark. She whispers something.

Brianna mumbles something unintelligible.

LIPEZ
Did you do that?
Outside the car window, one of the cops gets pulled
straight up. Lipez misses it. The other Cops look up at
something we can’t see. They draw their guns and starts
shooting.
Lipez turns. He tries to get out, but he can’t. The
missing cop’s legs flop across the hood with his top half
still out of sight. He’s dragged across the hood with
some tremendous force. Then seconds later hits the wall
across the street like he was thrown out of a car.

A second cop is pulled up and moments later his head
falls on the windshield.
Lipez starts turning the ignition but the car won’t
start. Brianna just looks forward; at piece.

spraying blood on the passenger’s side window. He falls.
Behind him the coat of Candyman.
Lipez shakes in fear. He holds his gun on the man who’s
face he can’t see. All is quiet. The man outside begins
to slowly walk back and around the car.
Who are you?

LIPEZ

CANDYMAN
I am the writing on the walls... I
am the whisper in the alleyways...
I am the razor blade in the
halloween sweets...
Lipez watches Candyman circle till he come around to the
driver’s side window. Lipez is terrified. Candyman
lowers. He stares at Lipez with wild and angry glee.
LIPEZ
Please, don’t kill me.
Lipez shuts his pathetic eyes.

They will say I shed innocent
blood. You are far from innocent,
but they’ll say you were. That’s

breath. Candyman is gone.
Then, the SOUND OF RIPPED FLESH ERUPTS from the front
seat followed by LIPEZ’ BLOODCURDLING SCREAM. Lipez looks
down to his groin. Raising from the floor of the car from
the pedal area is Candyman’s face looking up from between
Lipez’ legs. Candyman Raises in front of Lipez in his own
seat tearing his belly open as he does. Blood bursts from
the cavity as Candyman rips passed the ribcage. Candyman
spills onto the front seat facing Brianna in the back
through the divider. Lipez is dead.
CANDYMAN

Brianna nods. She blinks and he’s gone.
